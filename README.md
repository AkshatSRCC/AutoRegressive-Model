# AutoRegressive-Model

Autoregressive Model : A linear model, where current period values are a sum of past outcomes multiplied by a numeric factor.
Xt = C + ϕ1Xt-1 + ϵt

ACF and PACF are plots that show the correlation between a time series and its own lagged values. ACF represents the correlation coefficient at each lag, while PACF represents the coefficient of the lag after controlling the effects of other lags. ACF and PACF are used to determine the order of AR, MA, and ARMA models for forecasting.

Log likelihood is the natural logarithm of the likelihood, which is a function of the probability of observing some data given a set of parameters. Log likelihood is a measure of goodness of fit for any model, and the higher the value, the better the model fits the data.
